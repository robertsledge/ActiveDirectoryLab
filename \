More to come later tonight or tomorrow, including setting up our domain controller, adding users, and of course, attacking it with exploits. 

Talk soon. Have a great day!

================================


I upped the RAM to 4GB for the installs, but will be bringing it back to 2 so I can host both Clients, the Domain Controller, as well as my Kali attack machine on the same laptop without running into RAM issues (16 GB total on laptop).

Ok, let's log in with our super secret password (Pa$$w0rd!)

Ok, so - Every time you start Server 2019, you should have Server Manager pop up.

When it does, we want to select 'Manage', and then 'Add Roles and Features' at the top:

Select 'Next' again:

Select your server from the list and hit 'Next':

On this screen, we want to select 'Active Directory Domain Services', highlighted above.

When you click on 'Active Directory Domain Services', this box will appear next.

Click 'Add Features':

If you've gotten this far on your own, AWESOME!

If you have to go back and Google a few things, that's fine too.

Sit tight. More content coming. Thanks!
