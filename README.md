# Active Directory Lab

I'll be building out an AD lab with VMs shortly in order to replicate certain attacks and recon methods.

I will add content as it becomes available.


================================


Server 2019 as Domain Controller

Settings as seen below. Keeping it friendly at 2 GB RAM, and deleted the floppy.

NAT will be used throughout.

Used the 2019 Standard Evaluation (Desktop Experience) choice at setup.

More to come later tonight or tomorrow, including setting up our domain controller, adding users, and of course, attacking it with exploits. 

Talk soon. Have a great day!

================================

Client Machines

Client Machines will be Windows 10 Enterprise Eval isos

I upped the RAM to 4GB for the installs, but will be bringing it back to 2 so I can host both Clients, the Domain Controller, as well as my Kali attack machine on the same laptop without running into RAM issues (16 GB total on laptop).
