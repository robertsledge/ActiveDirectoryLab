# Active Directory Lab

I'll be building out an AD lab with VMs shortly in order to replicate certain attacks and recon methods.

I will add content as it becomes available.

Server 2019 as Domain Controller

Settings as seen below. Keeping it friendly at 2 GB RAM, and deleted the floppy.

NAT will be used throughout.

Used the 2019 Standard Evaluation (Desktop Experience) choice at setup.

Using the super secret password of Pa$$w0rd!
