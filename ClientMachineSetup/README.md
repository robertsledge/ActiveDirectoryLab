# Active Directory Lab - Client Machine Setup




We will be installing Windows 10 Enterprise Evaluation Edition for our client machines.

As we did with the domain controller, we are keeping it at 2 GB RAM, and again deleted the floppy.

Let's start with the install settings:

Next again:

Setup will then ask you to sign in.

In the lower left, you will see an option to join to the domain instead. Slsect 'Domain Join Instead'.

Let's make a user account. Since this domain exists in the Better Call Saul timeline, this computer will belong to Jimmy McGill at Wexler & McGill.

We'll need some security questions for this account. Make sure you remember you answers!

I always select 'No' here:

When you come to this screen:

I just turn everything off. Then hit 'Accept':

The machine will reboot:

When we get to the desktop, go to the search br and type 'computer name', and rename this machine.

Since Jimmy works at Wexler & McGill, that's what we'll name this machine.
