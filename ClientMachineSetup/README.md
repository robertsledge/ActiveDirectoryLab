# Active Directory Lab - Client Machine Setup




We will be installing Windows 10 Enterprise Evaluation Edition for our client machines.

As we did with the domain controller, we are keeping it at 2 GB RAM, and again deleted the floppy.

Let's start with the install settings:

Setup will ask about your region. Select the appropriate setting and hit next:

Next again:

Setup will then ask you to sign in.

In the lower left, you will see an option to join to the domain instead. Slsect 'Domain Join Instead'.

Let's make a user account. Since this domain exists in the Better Call Saul timeline, this computer will belong to Jimmy McGill at Wexler & McGill.

Confirm his super secret password and hit next:

We'll need some security questions for this account. Make sure you remember you answers!

I always select 'No' here:

When you come to this screen:

![alt text](https://github.com/robertsledge/ActiveDirectoryLab/blob/main/media/43.JPG)

I just turn everything off. Then hit 'Accept':

The machine will reboot:

When we get to the desktop, go to the search br and type 'computer name', and click 'View Your PC Name'.

![alt text](https://github.com/robertsledge/ActiveDirectoryLab/blob/main/media/46.JPG)

Click 'Rename this PC'

![alt text](https://github.com/robertsledge/ActiveDirectoryLab/blob/main/media/47.JPG)

Since Jimmy works at Wexler & McGill, that's what we'll name this machine.

After you rename your PC, you will be prompter for another reboot:

![alt text](https://github.com/robertsledge/ActiveDirectoryLab/blob/main/media/49.JPG)

After the reboot, Jimmy will sign in:

Once you see your desktop, the client machine is set up.

Repeat or image as many clients as you will need for your application. 

For this project,. we will only be using two machines. 

For an exercise, try building the second one on your own. The second machine will be for Kim Wexler, who works at Hamlin, Hamlin, and McGill. They often shorten their name to HHM.

Try to do it on your own, but if you have to refer back here or Google a bit, no worries there!

Next stop - Adding users, groups, and policies, and then joining the machines to the domain.

Talk soon.
